# Controls

I was thinking like WASD first person shooter controls, where 'a' moves you 
left on timeline / back a frame, and 'd' moves your right on timeline / 
advance a frame.  And then there are other controls for capture, stop, and
resuming.

Controls List:
* s = Stop / pause
* p = stop / Pause
* r = Resume
* a = left on timeline / backwards a frame
* b = left on timeline / Backwards a frame
* d = right on timeline / forward a frame
* f = right on timeline / Forward a frame
* c = Capture

Everything else quits
